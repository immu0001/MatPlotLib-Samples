# MatPlotLib-Samples
Sample python programs by using MPL(MatPlotLib) Library

Matplotlib is a library for making 2D plots of arrays in Python. Although it has its origins in emulating the MATLAB®  graphics commands, it is independent of MATLAB, and can be used in a Pythonic, object oriented way. Although Matplotlib is written primarily in pure Python, it makes heavy use of NumPy and other extension code to provide good performance even for large arrays.

Finding no package that suited me just right, I did what any self-respecting Python programmer would do: rolled up my sleeves and dived in. Not having any real experience with computer graphics, I decided to emulate MATLAB’s plotting capabilities because that is something MATLAB does very well. This had the added advantage that many people have a lot of MATLAB experience, and thus they can quickly get up to steam plotting in python. From a developer’s perspective, having a fixed user interface (the pylab interface) has been very useful, because the guts of the code base can be redesigned without affecting user code.
